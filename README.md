README

Group 7 - Jonas B., Signe, Thomas T & Tim from Mercantec - Viborg College of Technology

This is the readme file for our whiteboard clock project.

v0.1 - 06/09-2018
First piece of code for the stepper motor, not tested yet.

v0.2 - 17-09-2018
Stepper motor code tested with a L9110S H-bridge Motor Driver and a Bipolar Stepper Motor, works like a charm.
Test code made for using an LCD display later on, tested, and it works, too.

v0.3 - 20/09-2018
Working clock using the LCD and user set start time has been made.
"DisplayTest.ino" removed, no longer has any use.

v0.4 - 24/09-2018
A little debugging done on the TimeDisplay code, a bit of maths added to the Stepper code, added files needed later on, and images.

v0.5 - 04/10-2018
Created "StepperMainCode.ino" and made functions for drawing numbers using the pen.

v0.6 - 11/10-2018
Fixed an error in README.
Renamed "StepperCode.ino" to "StepperBackupCode.ino", to be able to go back to an old version of the code, if something goes wrong.
Some stuff with libraries that doesn't work yet.
