First piece of code for the stepper motor, not tested yet.

v0.2 - 17-09-2018
Stepper motor code tested with a L9110S H-bridge Motor Driver and a Bipolar Stepper Motor, works like a charm.
Test code made for using an LCD display later on, tested, and it works, too.

Working clock using the LCD and user set start time has been made.
"DisplayTest.ino" removed, no longer has any use.
